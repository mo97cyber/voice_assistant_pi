A personal, modular voice assistant using OpenAI Whisper for now â€“ running locally soon, still in progress

**Hey Chat** is a voice-controlled assistant I developed as part of my Digital Engineering studies.  
It uses **Whisper by OpenAI** for speech recognition, runs locally over **Wi-Fi**, and operates without relying on cloud services. It responds to personal voice commands â€“ for example, to:

- search Weather
- search Wikipedia
- or simply speak a sentence aloud
- and get an answer from Chatgpt as a voice assistant

ðŸ’¡ **Technologies**: Python Â· Whisper Â· pyttsx3/gtts (Text-to-Speech) Â· Modular Design Â· Raspberry Pi ( -> not fully modified yet)

ðŸŽ¯ **Future-Goal**: To build a privacy-friendly, locally running voice assistant that is modular, expandable, and helpful in everyday situations.

ðŸš§ **Status**: The assistant currently runs locally via microphone/Speaker and Whisper over Wi-Fi. Some features like wake word detection, user guidance, and Raspberry Pi optimization are still in development.

ðŸ“‚ This project is open source â€“ feedback, ideas, or contributions are very welcome!
